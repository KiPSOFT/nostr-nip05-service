### What is NIP-05 for Nostr?
In the NIP-05 nostr protocol, a human-readable identifier is used instead of a public key to describe users.

This identifier is often described as something similar to an email address.

For example, using an address like me@nostrprotocol.net allows your friends to easily find and follow you as a follower with this address.
